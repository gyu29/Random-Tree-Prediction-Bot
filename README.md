## üìã Requirements

```
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.20.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
ta>=0.8.0
joblib>=1.0.0
requests>=2.25.0
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone or download the system files
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn ta joblib requests
```

3. Get a free Alpha Vantage API key from [alphavantage.co](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)

4. Update the API key in the script:
```python
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## üìÅ Data Structure

### Historical Data Directory
Create a `./historical_data/` directory and place your historical stock data files in supported formats:
- CSV files (*.csv)
- Excel files (*.xlsx)
- Parquet files (*.parquet)

### Required Data Columns
Your data files must contain these columns (case-insensitive):
- `Date` or datetime index
- `Open`
- `High` 
- `Low`
- `Close`
- `Volume`

Optional columns:
- `Adj Close` (adjusted close price)
- `Dividends`
- `Stock Splits`

## üéØ Usage

### Command Line Interface

Run the system:
```bash
python swing_trading_system.py
```

The interactive menu provides 5 options:

#### 1. Train New Model
- Processes historical data from `./historical_data/` directory
- Creates technical indicators
- Trains Random Forest classifier
- Saves model files for future use

**Parameters:**
- `swing_threshold`: Minimum price movement to consider a swing (default: 0.15 = 15%)
- `lookforward_periods`: Days to look ahead for swing detection (default: 10)

#### 2. Analyze Single Symbol
- Fetches real-time data for a specific stock
- Generates buy/sell recommendation
- Provides probability scores and confidence levels
- Calculates stop-loss and take-profit levels

#### 3. Monitor Multiple Symbols
- Continuously monitors multiple stocks
- Alerts when high-probability opportunities are found
- Customizable check intervals and alert thresholds

#### 4. Run Backtest
- Tests strategy performance on historical data
- Provides win rate, average profit, and trade statistics
- Shows performance by exit reason (stop-loss, take-profit, max time)

#### 5. Exit
- Safely shuts down the system

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from swing_trading_system import SwingTradingSystem

# Initialize system
system = SwingTradingSystem(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Train model
system.train_model(
    data_directory="./historical_data",
    swing_threshold=0.15,
    lookforward_periods=10
)

# Analyze a symbol
result = system.analyze_symbol("AAPL")

# Run backtest
backtest_results = system.run_backtest("AAPL", days_back=90)

# Monitor symbols
system.monitor_symbols(["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"], check_interval=300)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Model Parameters
```python
# Random Forest Configuration
n_estimators = 100
max_depth = 8
min_samples_split = 20
min_samples_leaf = 10
class_weight = {0: 1, 1: 50}  # Heavy weight for swing opportunities
```

### Risk Management
```python
# Stop-loss and take-profit calculation
risk_reward_ratio = 0.5
minimum_stop_loss = 1% or 1 ATR
take_profit = max(swing_threshold, 2 * ATR)
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For Better Results:
1. **More Data**: Use at least 2-3 years of historical data
2. **Quality Data**: Ensure clean, complete OHLCV data
3. **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust swing_threshold based on market conditions
4. **Regular Retraining**: Retrain model monthly with new data
5. **Risk Management**: Always use stop-losses and position sizing

### Handling Class Imbalance:
- The system uses class weights to handle rare swing opportunities
- Creates synthetic positive samples when needed
- Uses out-of-bag scoring for better validation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Insufficient data" error:**
- Ensure you have at least 500 data points for training
- Check that your data files have the required columns

**"Missing required columns" error:**
- Verify column names match expected format
- The system will attempt to standardize column names automatically

**API rate limiting:**
- Free Alpha Vantage API has rate limits (5 calls/minute, 500 calls/day)
- Add delays between API calls for multiple symbol monitoring

**Low swing detection rate:**
- Try lowering the swing_threshold parameter
- Increase lookforward_periods for longer-term swings
- Ensure sufficient historical data for training

## üìù Model Files

After training, the system saves:
- `swing_model_enhanced.pkl` - Trained Random Forest model
- `swing_scaler_enhanced.pkl` - Feature scaler
- `feature_columns_enhanced.pkl` - Required feature list
- `training_stats.pkl` - Training performance metrics
